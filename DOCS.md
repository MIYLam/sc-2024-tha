# Notes for self 

- The f(*driver) is used to access the needed functions
- The filepaths that are printed at the start are used by the get sample data function, don't need to touch. 

# Main approach
- Find all files in an organisation 
- Find all the ones with the target directory + something after it
- Print that out
## Reasoning:
    - Spec says all children, and examples have grandchildren included as well 
# Progress track by commit

- Never used Go before, so needed some time to look through the structure of the package
- Looking at basic IO and calling the target functions.
